# StarHackIt React Frontend

An ES6 React based Frontend starter kit.




## Development and build process

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is used to define the 3rd party dependencies required by the frontend. *npm* comes with [node](https://nodejs.org) so make sure there are already installed:

    $ node -v
    v4.2.2

    $ npm -v
    2.14.7

These are the main *npm* commands for a normal developer workflow:

| npm command    | details  |
|----------------|----------|
| `npm install`  | Install dependencies  |
| `npm start`    | Start a development web server  |
| `npm test`     |  Perform the end to end testing |
| `npm run build`| Create a production build  |
| `npm run bundle-size`| Create a report to show the size of each dependencies |

### Install

To download and install the dependencies set in [package.json](package.json):

    $ npm install

The `postinstall` npm script also installs the [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/) driver locally for end to end testing.

### Build & Serve

[Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) has become the defacto standard for building React frontend, it is configured through 3 files:

* [webpack.config.js](webpack.config.js): the configuration common to all environment.
* [webpack.dev.js](webpack.dev.js): the configuration for development environment. Thanks to the Webpack plugin `OpenBrowserPlugin`, a new browser page will be opened at the right URL i.e: `http://localhost:8080`
* [webpack.prod.js](webpack.prod.js): the configuration for production environment. The `DedupePlugin`, `UglifyJsPlugin` and the `CompressionPlugin` plugins are invoked to respectively remove code duplication, obfuscate and compress the code.

To run the development web server:

    $ npm start

> **Hot reloading**: Webpack detects any change in the code, it rebuilds automatically and pushes the new change the browser, no manual browser refresh required.

### Test

To execute the end to end testing, a.k.a _e2e testing_, first make sure the frontend and backend are running, then run:

    $ npm test

The end to end tests are executed by [nightwatch](http://nightwatchjs.org/) which uses the *Selenium* driver API.

The test suite can be found in [test/nightwatch](test/nightwatch)

### Production build

To build the production version:

    $ npm build


## Configuration

The file [src/app/config.js](src/app/config.js) gathers the common configuration and the environment specific configuration which is selected by defining the variable `NODE_ENV` to `production`, `development`, `uat` etc ...
The `NODE_ENV` variable is injected through the *webpack* plugin `DefinePlugin`.

## Logging

The [debug](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug) library is a convenient way to log messages with prefix.
Messages can be switch on and off depending on the prefix, see [src/app/app.js](src/app/app.js)

## CORS

To avoid [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) issues, the *webpack* development server is configured to act as a proxy server, requests beginning with `/api/v1/` are forwarded to the api server located at `http://localhost:9000`. See the *gulp* task `webpack-dev-server` in [gulpfile.js](gulpfile.js)

## Internationalization

The [i18next](http://i18next.com/) provides internationalization support for this project. Translations are retrieved at run time without bloating the application with all translations.

Here are the i18next plugins configured in [src/app/utils/i18n.js](src/app/utils/i18n.js):

* [i18next-browser-languagedetector](https://github.com/i18next/i18next-browser-languageDetector): language detector used in browser environment for i18next
* [i18next-localstorage-cache](https://github.com/i18next/i18next-localStorage-cache): caching layer for i18next using browsers localStorage
* [i18next-xhr-backend](https://github.com/i18next/i18next-xhr-backend): backend layer for i18next using browsers xhr

The translation files are located in [locales](locales) directory.

In your *React* component, import the `i18next` package and invoke the `t` function to translate the given key:


```
import tr from 'i18next';

...

    <h2 >{tr.t('login')}</h2>
```

* Internationalization with `i18next`
* Find bugs, enforce coding standards with `eslint` and its plugins: `react`, `promise`, `mocha`.
* Copy and paste detector with `jscpd`
* Display lint warnings and build errors to directly to the browser with `webpack-hud`
* Unit tests with `karma` and `mocha`
* Code coverage with `nyc`
* End to end tests with `nightwatch`

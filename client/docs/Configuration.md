## Configuration

The file [src/app/config.js](src/app/config.js) gathers the common configuration and the environment specific configuration which is selected by defining the variable `NODE_ENV` to `production`, `development`, `uat` etc ...
The `NODE_ENV` variable is injected through the *webpack* plugin `DefinePlugin`.

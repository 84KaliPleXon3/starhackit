# End 2 End Testing

To execute the end to end testing, a.k.a _e2e testing_, first make sure the frontend and backend are running, then run:

    $ npm run e2e

The end to end tests are executed by [nightwatch](http://nightwatchjs.org/) which uses the *chromedriver*.

The test suite can be found in [test/nightwatch](test/nightwatch)

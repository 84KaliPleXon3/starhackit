# Multi Application

Most of the time, they are multiple frontends for one application: the user facing frontend and the admin frontend.
Having separate git repository for these app causes a lot of maintenance and code sharing problem.
There are 4 frontend app in this repository:
* [app_user](../src/app_user)

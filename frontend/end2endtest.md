# End 2 End Testing

To execute the end to end testing, a.k.a _e2e testing_, first make sure the frontend and backend are running, then run:

```text
$ npm run e2e
```

The end to end tests are executed by [nightwatch](http://nightwatchjs.org/) which uses the _chromedriver_.

The test suite can be found in [test/nightwatch](https://github.com/FredericHeem/starhackit/tree/ea908f8d0fb4d8e4db36e275488ad863362cfee7/client/docs/test/nightwatch/README.md)

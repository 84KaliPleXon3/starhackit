# Workflow

## Yeoman generator

The easiest way to bootstrap your application is to use the [Starhackit Yeoman generator](https://github.com/FredericHeem/generator-starhackit).

First install *yo* and *generator-starhackit* globally:

```bash
npm install -g yo generator-starhackit
```

Finally, initiate the generator and answer the questions about your project:

```bash
mkdir yourproject && cd $_
yo starhackit
```

## Docker containers

To install the docker containers for the various services such as RabbitMq and Postgres on the local machine, the [DevLab](https://github.com/TechnologyAdvice/DevLab) project is being used to containerize the development workflow, see its configuration file: [devlab.yml](server/devlab.yml)


    # cd server
    # npm run devlabinstall

To check that the containers are running:

```
# docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                         NAMES
ccd9f559fabd        rabbitmq:latest     "/docker-entrypoint.s"   36 minutes ago      Up 36 minutes       4369/tcp, 25672/tcp, 0.0.0.0:5672->5672/tcp   devlab_rabbitmq_frederic_1446641005596
```
## Backend

Before running the backend, check and modify the configuration located at [server/config/default.json](server/config/default.json).
Don't forget to correctly set the *rabbitmq* server location.

To start the backend:

    # cd server
    # npm start

To test the backend:

    #Â npm test

It will not only test the code, but also checks the source code with eslint and generates a code coverage report located at `coverage/lcov-report/index.html`

For more information about the backend, see its [README](server/README.md)

## Frontend

To run the frontend webserver:

    # npm start

For more information about the frontend, see its [README](client/README.md)

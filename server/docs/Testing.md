## Functional and Unit Testing

Here is the command to run the mocha test suite:

    $Â npm run mocha

When working on the source code, it is best to run mocha with the *--watch* options, when a file is saved, the tests are executed again.

    $ npm run mocha:watch

 > To execute on one test, add *.only* to *it* or *describe*
